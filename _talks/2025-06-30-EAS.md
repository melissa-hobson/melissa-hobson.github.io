Between 2018 and 2023, the ESPRESSO consortium followed up some 50 stars hosting small transiting planet candidates from K2 and TESS, as part of the ESPRESSO Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO). In this presentation, I focussed on the lessons learned from this program that should be kept in mind for the follow-up of the PLATO targets, with emphasis on the mitigation of stellar activity.
