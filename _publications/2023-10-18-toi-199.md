We present the spectroscopic confirmation and precise mass measurement of the warm giant planet TOI-199 b. This planet was first identified in TESS photometry and confirmed using ground-based photometry from ASTEP in Antarctica including a full 6.5 h long transit, PEST, Hazelwood, and LCO; space photometry from NEOSSat; and radial velocities (RVs) from FEROS, HARPS, CORALIE, and CHIRON. Orbiting a late G-type star, TOI-199 b has a \\$104.854^{+0.001}_{-0.002}$\\ d period, a mass of 0.17 ± 0.02 M\\$_\mathrm{J}$\\, and a radius of 0.810 ± 0.005 R$_\\\mathrm{J}$\\. It is the first warm exo-Saturn with a precisely determined mass and radius. The TESS and ASTEP transits show strong transit timing variations, pointing to the existence of a second planet in the system. The joint analysis of the RVs and TTVs provides a unique solution for the non-transiting companion TOI-199 c, which has a period of \\$273.69^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$\\ d and an estimated mass of \\$0.28^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$\\ M\\$_\mathrm{J}$\\. This period places it within the conservative Habitable Zone.
