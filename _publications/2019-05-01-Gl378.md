We present the detection of a Warm Neptune orbiting the M-dwarf Gl378, using radial velocity measurements obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. The star was observed in the context of the SOPHIE exoplanets consortiumâ€™s subprogramme dedicated to finding planets around M-dwarfs. Gl378 is an M1 star, of solar metallicity, at a distance of 14.96 pc. The single planet detected, Gl378 b, has a minimum mass of 13.02 MEarth and an orbital period of 3.82 days, which place it at the lower boundary of the Hot Neptune desert. As one of only a few such planets around M-dwarfs, Gl378 b provides important clues to the evolutionary history of these close-in planets. In particular, the eccentricity of 0.1 may point to a high-eccentricity migration. The planet may also have lost part of its envelope due to irradiation.
