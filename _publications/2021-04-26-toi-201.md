We present the confirmation of the eccentric warm giant planet TOI-201 b, first identified as a candidate in TESS photometry (Sectors 1-8, 10-13, and 27-28) and confirmed using ground-based photometry from NGTS and radial velocities from FEROS, HARPS, CORALIE, and Minerva-Australis.
TOI-201 b orbits a young (0.87+0.46−0.49 Gyr) and bright(V=9.07 mag) F-type star with a 52.9781 d period. The planet has a mass of 0.42+0.05−0.03 MJ, a radius of 1.008+0.012−0.015 RJ, and an orbital eccentricity of 0.28+0.06−0.09; it appears to still be undergoing fairly rapid cooling, as expected given the youth of the host star. The star also shows long-term variability in both the radial velocities and several activity indicators, which we attribute to stellar activity. The discovery and characterization of warm giant planets such as TOI-201 b is important for constraining formation and evolution theories for giant planets.
