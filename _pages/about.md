I'm an astrophysicist working on exoplanet detection and characterization through radial velocities and transit photometry. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, where I'm investigating warm giant planets. 

Previously, I did my undergrad in Cordoba, Argentina, on "Multiple Exoplanetary Systems", with Prof. Mercedes Gomez, and my PhD at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille,
Université d’Aix-Marseille, France, on “Exoplanet Detection Around M-dwarfs with Near Infrared and Visible Spectroscopy", with Dr. Isabelle Boisse & Prof. François Bouchy. I was then a postdoctoral researcher at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica in Santiago, Chile for two years.
